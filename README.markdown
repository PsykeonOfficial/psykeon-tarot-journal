# THE PSYKEON TAROT JOURNAL
Built in a dark neon lit room by *Nikodemus of Psykeon*

## Welcome, runner.
You’ve jacked into the Psykeon Tarot Journal, a clandestine grimoire for technomancers, a digital record for modern diviners.  
This isn't your corp’s sanitized and proprietary software; it’s a raw and open source conduit to the arcane, built for those who have a foot in code, and a foot in the occult.
In a world where data is currency and privacy just an illusion, this journal fully hands you the keys to your own occult data.
No gatekeepers. no grid, No middlemen. Just, you, your cards, and the red glowing code of spiritual liberty and self-direction.
Crafted with a DIY cyberpunk ethos, this journal is released under the GLPv3 license, so tinker with it, share it, and evolve it while keeping the Nikodemus of Psykeon spirit burning (see LICENSE for more information).  

## Arsenal
- **Entirely free**: Keep your gold, wizard. I'm just here to help.  
- **Contextual Divination**: Date, time, location, weather, stars, questions, spreads. Log every variable related to your readings.  
- **Deck Agnostic**: Log your readings from any tarot and oracle deck (even runes if you want). This journal bends to your will—your tools, your rules.  
- **Virtual Deck**: No physical cards? Summon the built-in Psykeon Virtual Tarot Deck directly from within the app.  
- **Emotional Resonance**: Track the mood of seekers and seers. Contrary to machines, our physical reactions influence our interpretation of symbols.  
- **Data Sovereignty**: Your readings stay between your hands; localStorage for quick access, or CSV exports for off-grid data hoarding and self-direct data analysis. No cloud, no corps, no compromise.  
- **Zero Install**: Runs lean directly from your rig. No bloat, no signup; just direct access.  
- **Open Source, Open Soul**: Free as in freedom. Tinker with it, spread it, evolve it, and keep the Psykeon spirit burning.

## Jack In
**Acquire the Code**:  
- Pull it from the shadows: `git clone https://github.com/PsykeonOfficial/psykeon-tarot-journal`  

**Initialize the Ritual**:  
- Ensure the (included) Medodica and NotoSansSymbols fonts sit in your `fonts/` directory—they are the sigils that binds the aesthetic. Missing them? Hunt them down from the source (see Font Attribution and LICENSE).  
- Fire up `psykeon-tarot-journal.html` in your favorite browser; No server needed; this runs clean and local, off the grid.

## Operate the Console
- Hit **"Create an Entry"** to log a reading with your physical cards, or **"Create a Virtual Entry"** to call forth the digital arcana.  
- Input your data on the creation screen. When you’re done, **"Save entry"** locks it into `localStorage`; **"Save Entry as CSV"** exports it for safekeeping.  
- Saved readings materialize on the main console. Organize them in ascending or descending order according to their date.  
- Need to pull data from your device? **"Load Entry"** imports CSV files into the mix.  
- **"Save All Entries"** compiles your entire journal into one CSV, perfect for backups or deep analysis.  
- To purge an entry, hit the **'X'** next to it, or the **"Clear All Entries"** if you're a mad lad. No traces, no ghosts, no recovery (put pure individual responsibility).

## Glyphs of Power
At first, I was using a good ol' green code rain in the background, but my great friend Philignis the Pyromancer inspired me to give it a more occult tech-noir twist.  
This project channels the **Medodica** font by Roberto Mocci, and the **NotoSansSymbols** font by the Noto Project Authors. These pixel-perfect and symbolic scripts anchor the journal’s soul, a bridge between the digital and the occult.
